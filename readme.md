## Summary:

HTML5 Reset is a simple set of best practices to get your Concrete5 web projects off on the right foot.

1. A style sheet designed to strip initial files from browsers, meaning you start off with a blank slate.
2. Easy to customize -- remove whatever you don't need, keep what you do.
5. Empty mobile and print media queries, including blocks for device orientation
6. Modernizr.js [http://www.modernizr.com/](http://www.modernizr.com/) detects HTML5 & CSS3 compatibility across various browsers.
7. IE-specific classes for simple CSS-targeting
9. Lots of other keen stuff...
